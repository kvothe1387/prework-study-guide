          <li>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.Through this work we have come to value,</li>
          <br />
            <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools,</li>
            <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation,</li>
            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation,</li>
            <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
          <br />
          <li>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</li>

        <h2>The 12 Principals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
          <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
          <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
          <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
          <li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
          <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
          <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
          <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
          <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
          <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</li>
          <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
          <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
